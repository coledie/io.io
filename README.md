# io.io

Template for quickly building .io gams.

The template is in the branch _template_.
Each game is based off of the template branch into their own branch.
Development branches should be named as _gamename_/_featurename_

## What is an .io game

.io games are simple web based projects where you compete against a large number of bots in a sort of 100 player free for all, single winner type game. For example, agar.io and paper.io.
Only a small percentage of games in this genre have achieved enough success to make their creators rich, thus in order to profit these games need to be pumped out like a factory.

## How to use the template

Using the template is as simple as branching off of the template branch
and customizing it to the needs of the game.
